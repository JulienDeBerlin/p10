### **Description of the initial project (project 7)**

This project was about to develop the new IT system of a public librairies network. 

It includes **two clients applications**: 
* 1/ **a webapp** for the users to perform book research and extend loans
* 2/ **a batch** which automates the sending of reminder emails for overdue books.

and **one webservice**: 
The architecture choosen for this system is a Service Orientated Architecture: the business logic and the data layer are performed by a SOAP web service and all above mentionned apps consume or will consume data from this webservice. 

Project 7 was spread over two git repos: [one for the webservice](https://github.com/JulienDeBerlin/p7-librairyManagement-webservice)
and [one for the webapp and the batch](https://github.com/JulienDeBerlin/p7-librairyManagement-webapp). For purpose of project 10, both repos has been merged in this single repo.
